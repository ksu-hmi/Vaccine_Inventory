# Vaccine_Inventory
InvenVac is a real-time inventory system and tracking software application  that allows employees of HIP Nation Clinics to keep track of vaccines and be able to monitor injections and vaccine inventory. The main purpose of this software application is to track sales data, utilization of  vaccines by location, and simplify the process of ordering vaccines/ injections. In addition, the best part of this software application is having all data related to vaccines in one place with one simple click, and is beneficial for a company with multiple offices or locations. We will be creating a KIVY: Cross-Platform Python Framework for NUI Development for our software application.
